\\ To use this function, you would call sleep-sort and pass it the list of numbers you want to sort 
\\ and the length of the list. 
\\ For example, to sort the list [5, 3, 1, 4, 2], you would call: 5 3 1 4 2 5 sleep-sort. 
\\ This would output the sorted list to the console. 
\\ Note that this implementation is purely theoretical, 
\\ as FORTH not have any built-in support for multithreading.
